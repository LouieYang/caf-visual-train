# A simple shell script to visualize caffe training

We discribe a very simple shell script for visualize the caffe training details. The visualization isn't real-time.

### Requirement
1. The zsh isn't necessary, /bin/shell is fine 
2. The datas are plotted using gnuplot[1], so gnuplot is necessary 
3. The caffe[2] modules are also necessary

### Sample Effect
